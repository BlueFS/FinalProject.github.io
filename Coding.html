        <h2><i>The Different Languages and What They Do</i></h2>
    </div>

<div class = "info">
    <p>There are 8,000 or so coding languages in the world, and each one serves their own purpose. For today, though, we will go over some of the most commonly used languages. These include Python, C, C++, C#, Java, Scratch, and HTML. Later on, you will also have the ability to edit the HTML and CSS code of this very website!</p>
    <h2><b>Binary</b></h2>
    <p>Before we begin to talk about code, we need to have a slight understanding on how computers work and read code. You may have heard the word binary, which is the system that computers use to count. Furthermore, computers use <i>bits</i>, which is derived from the term <i>binary digit</i>, as the smallest unit of digital information. A bit can be a 0 or 1 which stands for off or on, respectively. This is because computers are made of transistors, which can only be on or off. Computers use the state of these transistors to store information which can associate the 0s and 1s with letters, numbers, and symbols. Because of this, bits are the fundamental building blocks of digital systems and are used to represent data.</p>
    <p>Here are some examples for counting in binary:</p>
    <p>Zero: 0 0 0</p>
    <p>One: 0 0 1</p>
    <p>Two: 0 1 0</p>
    <p>Three: 0 1 1</p>
    <p>Four: 1 0 0</p>
    <h2><b>ASCII</b></h2>
    <p>Just as numbers are binary patterns, so are letters. The ASCII standarad was created to map specific letters to specific numbers. For example, the letter A is mapped to number 65, which is 01000001 in binary. Ultimately, because binary has a limit of 255, we are limited to the number of characters which can be represented by ASCII.</p>
    <h2><b>Compilers</b></h2>
    <p>Now that you know that computers can only read in 0s and 1s, you might be wondering how this website is written. Many might think that I mashed a bunch of 0s and 1s to make what is seen, but that is far from the truth. It actually looks something like this:</p>

<div class = "info">
    <p>As you can see, this code is written in English. You might be wondering: How could that be? The answer is simple: compilers. The job of compilers is to take <i>source code</i>, instructions written by a programmer for the computer to execute, and convert it into binary.</p>
