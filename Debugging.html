        <p>When it comes to coding, many things can go wrong. The program might fail to run as expected, might crash after a while, or not even run at all. When reviewing code, the mistakes can be the cause of forgetting a semicolon, missing braces, typos, and more. Likewise, there are many ways to aid in the problem solving, and these solutions range from talking to a rubber duck (also known as rubber-duck debugging) all the way to using AI to read and propose fixes to your code. A method that I sometimes use is an AI that Harvard created to help their students that take CS50. The website name is <a href = "https://cs50.ai/"target = "_blank">cs50.ai</a> and it can greatly help you with your coding troubles. It takes on the role of a rubber-duck, but one that can actually talk. Speaking of rubber-ducks, Harvard's computer science students love rubber-ducks, so here's a song about them:</p>

        <p>If you couldn't tell by the big rubber-duck and the effort put into singing, they <i>REALLY </i>like rubber-ducks.</p>
