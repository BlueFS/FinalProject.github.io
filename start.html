        <p>A CERN employee, Tim Berners-Lee (Left), invented the World Wide Web in 1989. The first proposal of the World Wide Web was in March of 1989, and the second proposal was in May 1990. According to CERN, "The Web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world." The first web server ran at CERN, and funnily enough, had a label written in red ink to prevent anyone from accidentally shutting it off: "This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!" The first website ever created was <a href = "https://info.cern.ch"target = "_blank">info.cern.ch</a> (Feel free to visit it!) The website discusses the project itself, and contains info on how to create a web server, a description of hypertext, and links to other websites as they became available. In December of 1991, another web server came online in the Standford Linear Accelerator Center in Caliornia, and in early 1993, the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois released a first version of its Mosaic browser. It ran on the X Window System environment and offered a user-friendly browser. Stemming from this, the World Wide Web spread.</p>
